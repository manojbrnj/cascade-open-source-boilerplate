## Email tool of choice

Cascade uses [Loops](https://www.loops.so) for sending marketing and transactional emails. Loops is a powerful email marketing platform that allows you to send emails to your users, track their engagement, and set up funnels to automate your email marketing.

## Setup with Cascade

You need to have a Loops account to use the email feature in Cascade. If you don't have one, you can [sign up here](https://www.loops.so).

Grab your API key [from here](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api) and add it to your `.env` file:

```
#Loops
LOOPS_API_KEY="2a2ee7a090dldskfj4bd73eb3f70a"
```

## Sending emails

Cascade implements an example of a single loop, where an email is sent to the newly created users:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/loops.jpeg" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

When the loop is hit, it waits for a minute and then sends an email to the user. You can customize the email content and the delay between the loop and the email and set up more complex funnels as WebGLUniformLocation.\_createMdxContent

This is how you trigger loops:

```ts
await loops.sendEvent(
  {
    email: user.email,
  },
  "cascade_sign_up",
  {
    ...(user.name && { name: user.name }),
    email: user.email,
  }
);
```
