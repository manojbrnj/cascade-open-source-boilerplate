## Get started with core of Cascade

Cascade relies on Prisma for database management and Postgres for data storage. This guide will help you set up a local development environment with a Postgres database.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Alternative databases">
    You can easily replace Posgres with other databases supported by Prisma.
    Check out the Prisma documentation for more information.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/d-ivashchuk/cascade.git
```

Spin up Postgres in docker headless mode.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Setup with existing Postgres">
    If you are using hosted Postgres, you can skip the docker step and populate
    the connection string in the `.env` file with your existing database URL.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Copy env variables from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Be sure to populate database urls; at this stage, they are the most important thing to get started locally:

```.env
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="postgresql://admin:admin@localhost:5432/cascade_db"
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="postgresql://admin:admin@localhost:5432/cascade_db"
```

Migrate Prisma & generate client:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Install dependencies & run application

```
pnpm install && pnpm run dev
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion
    icon="database"
    title="Populate test users for User Management table"
  >
  If you want to have some basic data to work with, you can populate the User table immediately by running the following command:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

## Add Discord authentication

<Tip>

This section is borrowed from the [T3 app documentation](https://create.t3.gg/en/usage/next-auth#setting-up-the-default-discordprovider) as Casdcade is basing on T3.

</Tip>

1. Head to [the Applications section in the Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and click on "New Application"
2. In the settings menu, go to "OAuth2 => General"

- Copy the Client ID and paste it in `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` in `.env`.
- Under Client Secret, click "Reset Secret" and copy that string to `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`. Be careful as you won't be able to see this secret again, and resetting it will cause the existing one to expire.
- Click "Add Redirect" and paste in `<app url>/api/auth/callback/discord` (example for local development: <code class="break-all">http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord</code>)
- Save your changes
- It is possible, but not recommended, to use the same Discord Application for both development and production. You could also consider [Mocking the Provider](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/main/examples/next-prisma-websockets-starter/src/pages/api/auth/%5B...nextauth%5D.ts) during development.

## Sign in into the application

Head to the login page(`http://localhost:3000`) and click on the Discord button to sign in with your Discord account.

<Tip>

Cascade relies on roles to manage user permissions. By default, the user is assigned the `USER` role. You can change the role in the database by updating the `role` field in the `User` table.

You need to change your user role to `SUPER_ADMIN` to get access to all features

</Tip>
