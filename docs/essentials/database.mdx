## Database of choice

Cascade uses [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as its database of choice. Postgres is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

## ORM of choice

<Tip>This section mentions something about Authentication</Tip>

Cascade uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as its ORM of choice. Prisma is a modern database toolkit that makes database access easy with an auto-generated and type-safe query builder that's tailored to your database schema.

Prisma connects really well to Postgres & NextAuth trough an adapter that makes it easy to use.

Whenever you want to make changes to database schema, you can do so by changing the schema in the `schema.prisma` file and then running `npx prisma migrate dev` to generate a migration file and apply the changes to the database.

## Database schema
