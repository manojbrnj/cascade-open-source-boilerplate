# Concept

The idea of the Cascade template is that it offers as little bloat as possible regarding technology choices and gets you started with writing business logic from day one. The only friction before fully working boilerplate on your `localhost:3000` is the `.env` file with correct environmental variables.

# Honorable mentions

- Without [Shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn) this boilerplate would not happen. Period. I rely on his UI a lot and took a lot of inspiration & code from his open-source projects
- https://github.com/lmsqueezy/nextjs-billing & [Branko's](https://twitter.com/brankoconjic) work on it; I took a bunch of ideas for LS integration there
- https://github.com/sadmann7/shadcn-table & [Sadman](https://twitter.com/sadmann17) for showcasing brilliant integration of Tanstack table with Shadcn/ui, I repurposed the code for Prisma
- [Pontus](https://twitter.com/pontusab) and his impeccable tech stack in [Midday.ai](https://midday.ai/) inspired me to create the boilerplate at the first place
