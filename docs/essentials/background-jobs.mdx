## Background jobs tool of choice

Cascade uses [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) as its background job tool of choice. Trigger.dev is a simple, reliable, and easy-to-use tool that allows you to schedule and run background jobs in a few simple steps.

## What is a background job

A background job is a task that is executed outside the normal flow of your application. It is typically used to perform tasks that are not time-sensitive, such as sending emails, sending notifications or even running a generation with AI.

Cascade uses background jobs to send Slack notifications so if you want to get notified on new users or on new payments - you need to enable Slack integration on Trigger.dev platform.

In general job definitions are pretty simple and should serve you as a good example if you want to create your own jobs.

That is the definition of a job:

```ts
export const slackNewUserNotification = triggerClient.defineJob({
  id: "cascade-new-user",
  name: "Cascade new user notification",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "cascade.new.user",
    schema: z.object({
      user: z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        email: z.string().email().optional(),
        id: z.string(),
      }),
    }),
  }),
  integrations: {
    slack,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.slack.postMessage("post message", {
      channel: "C06RZ0QNP6W",
      text: `ðŸ”¥ *New user signed up*\n\nName: ${payload.user.name}\nEmail: ${payload.user.email}\nID:${payload.user.id}`,
    });
  },
```

And that's how you invoke a job:

```ts
await slackNewUserNotification.invoke({
  user: {
    name: user.name ?? "unknown",
    email: user.email ?? undefined,
    id: user.id,
  },
});
```

## How to use Trigger.dev with Cascade

First, you need to create a Trigger.dev account. Once you have an account, you can create a new project and get your API key.

Populate the related environment variables in your `.env` file:

```yml
#Trigger.dev
TRIGGER_API_KEY=tr_dev_iTsdlfkjyeD33yimXrW2N
TRIGGER_API_URL=https://api.trigger.dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIGGER_PUBLIC_API_KEY=pk_dev_2AO1S8wxhEfsdlkjlksjdf
```
