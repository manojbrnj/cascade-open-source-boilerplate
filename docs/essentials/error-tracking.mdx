## Error tracking tool of choice

Cascade uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for error tracking. Sentry is an open-source error tracking tool that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. It provides a comprehensive view of the errors that occur in your application, and helps you understand the impact of each error.

## Set up Sentry with Cascade

To set up Sentry with Cascade, you need to create a Sentry account and get a DSN (Data Source Name) for your project. The DSN is a unique identifier that Sentry uses to track errors in your application.

After you have gone trough the setup process, you can add all of the related variabls to your `.env` file:

```yml
#Sentry
SENTRY_DSN="https://asdjflkjsdkfljksdlfjslkdjf@o4506388280180736.ingest.us.sentry.io/4506978350399488"
SENTRY_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"
SENTRY_ORG="YOUR_SENTRY_ORG"
```
