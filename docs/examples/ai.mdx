## AI tool of choice

Cascade uses [Open AI](https://openai.com/) as its AI tool of choice. Open AI is a cloud-based AI platform that provides access to a wide range of AI services, including text generation, image generation, and more.

<Tip>
  You need to add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file to use Open AI features
  if you clone Cascade.

## Example of AI usage

There is a simple example of AI usage in Cascade. You can find it [here](https://cascade.stackonfire.com/app/examples). It uses Open AI to generate a launch plan for a SaaS project.

The integration is pretty simple and uses OpenAI function calling. The function is called `generateSaaSPlan` and it takes in a few parameters. The parameters are validated using Zod and the function returns a parsed launch plan arguments displayed in the UI.

```ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { openai } from "~/lib/openai";

import { createTRPCRouter, protectedProcedure } from "~/server/api/trpc";

const actionableStepSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  description: z.string().max(200),
});

const launchPlanArgsSchema = z.object({
  productName: z.string(),
  productDescription: z.string(),
  actionableSteps: z.array(actionableStepSchema),
});

export const aiRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  generateProjectPlan: protectedProcedure
    .input(
      z.object({ projectName: z.string(), projectDescription: z.string() }),
    )
    .mutation(async ({ input }) => {
      const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
