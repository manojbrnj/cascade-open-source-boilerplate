# Why

Hey, my name is Dima and I've built yet another boilerplate. There are tons of the awesome ones out there on the internet including critically acclaimed [ShipFast](https://shipfa.st/), [Supastarter](https://supastarter.dev/) or [Shipped](https://shipped.club/). They all pack a great offer and can get you started with your business really fast!

I've built a boilerplate not because I wanted to compete with those, but from rather _selfish reasons_. **I've been laid off** two weeks ago and decided to go 100% indie. I've had numerous successful and semi-successful projects in the past including an exit & grew [Lost Pixel](https://www.lost-pixel.com/) from scratch to a promising B2B SaaS. I have my favorite stack, tools and am pretty opinionated about how things should be done. Cascade embodies all of that.

I have bunch of ideas and I don't have time to validate them all. I set a timeline of 6 months to get to a traction that would cover my expenses & lifestyle and **Cascade is a part of that plan**.

I will use it to kickstart multiple SaaS projects and share the progress with you, moreover I will extend the boilerplate with features that I will need for my projects, meaning that you will get a lot of updates and improvements over time.

> **Cascade is not a boilerplate** it is a documentation of a SaaS building journey.

# What's included

I want to keep the boilerplate as simple as possible. I pack mostly Open Source & Self Hosted tools into it because I don't like vendor locks as much as you do. You can check out the [extensive docs here](https://stackonfire.mintlify.app/introduction) or [jump straight to the demo](https://cascade.stackonfire.com/app/login) and try it out yourself. The code is [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/d-ivashchuk/cascade) and contributions are very much welcome!
