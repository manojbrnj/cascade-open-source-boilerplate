## Concept

The idea of **Cascade** template is that it offers as little bloat as possible when it comes to technology choices. The only friction before fully working boilerplate on your `localhost:3000` is `.env` file with correct envorinmental variables and a database running.

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher).
</Info>
<Tip>

Cascade barebone setup is a Next.js app with Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL database.

It takes around 10-20 minutes to set up the project locally and start developing
your SaaS application.

</Tip>

<Warning>

To have all services up and running, you would require couple of hours and it will mostly be setting up the hosted versions. **Good news** is that you can start with the barebone setup and add services as you go.

</Warning>
