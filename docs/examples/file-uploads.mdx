## File storage tool of choice

Cascade uses [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com/) as its file upload tool of choice. Uploadthing is a simple file uploader that allows you to upload files to your cloud storage.

<Tip>
You need to add `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` & `UPLOADTHING_SECRET` to your `.env` file to use Uploadthing features if you clone Cascade.

</Tip>

## Setup with Cascade

Cascade uses awesome work of [Sadman Sakib](https://github.com/sadmann7) to make file uploads easy. The implementation combines `react-dropzone` & `shadcn/ui` components to make the whole process as simple as possible.
